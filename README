 django-template-porting-util
==============================

Python utility for porting Django template syntax from .9x to 1.0.

This program automates much of the process of moving your Django templates from
Django .9x to Django 1.0. It is safe to re-run this program on templates if,
for example, you are porting templates while the old templates are still in use
and subject to change. Just put any new templates in the template directory and
re-run. Remember that you can also point to a specific directory, or even a
specific template.

Warning
-------
This program irreversibly alters your templates! It is essential that
you use some form of version control or at least make backups of your files
before every use.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.5 or 2.6
* Django 1.0 or later

This script grew out a script by `Christian Metts <http://mintchaos.com/>`_,
which itself was a modified version of a script by
`Jacob Kaplan-Moss <http://jacobian.org/>`_.

Further, this would not exist with out the help of
`Daniel Lindsley <http://toastdriven.com/>`_.

Much of the good in this utility is their fault. All of the bad is mine. :)
