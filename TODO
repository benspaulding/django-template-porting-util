These are all good ideas that would make the script safer and more useful,
but let's be realistic: I will never get to them.

- Implement --dry-run option,
- Implement --verbose and --quiet options, along with standard printing,
- Add a an --in-place option (with a prompt) and make copying the
  template dirs the default action, (will require another option, i.e.
  --output -o)
- Make a design decision re following symlinks,
- Research and implement proper setup.py,
- Tune regular expression replacements,

    - Account for related_names when making list/count replacements,
    - Match only within {% %} and {{ }},

- Write more tests,
- Change TemplateMonkey to accept kwargs object,
- Move tests to their own module,
