 TODO

- Implement --dry-run option,
- Implement --verbose and --quiet options, along with standard printing,
- Research and implement proper setup.py,
- Implement that important bit, even the regular expression replacements. :)

    - Account for extensions list to avoid ``.html.html.html`` when re-run,
    - Account for the ``get_`` somehow (nothing is matching ignored_methods),
    - Account for related_names when making list/count replacements,

- Write more tests,
- Change TemplateMonkey to accept something other than options object,
